    text: "Hello, my name is Yacquub Adan. I'm a recent graduate looking for an opportunity to begin my career in web development. My interest in programming started during work experience at secondary school where I worked for a company named NIACE (National Institute of Adult Education). I became really invested and would ask questions to staff working in the tech department which led them to introduce me to scratch; a visual programming language aimed for children to kick start their journey. During the end of my time there, they kindly gifted me a laptop. The experience played a massive role on my interests in this field. Fast-forward to today and i feel excited to start the next chapter! ",

    text: "At De Montfort University, I studied Computer Science and enjoyed some very interesting topics, such as computer systems and networks, object-oriented programming, data structures and algorithms, software development methodologies, and much more. To summarize my experience with this course, it helped me improve my understanding of how computers work behind-the-scenes, team working skills, and my time management, such as sticking to deadlines. As a result, i graduated with a first-class honours and i'm very proud of my university experience as a whole.",
