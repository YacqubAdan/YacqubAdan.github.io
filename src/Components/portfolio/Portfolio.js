                  As a dedicated member of my local community, I was involved in
                  a project to revamp and digitally transform the old website
                  for our local mosque. Working closely with a team of fellow
                  volunteers, I utilized my technical skills in website design
                  and development to create a user-friendly and visually
                  appealing website which is soon to be deployed.

                  The Netflix clone project was something I was really
                  interested in because not only do I enjoy watching films, but
                  I really enjoy the look of the companyâ€™s website. From the
                  site 'TheMovieDatabase' I was able to acquire an API that
                  essentially allowed me to construct the website. During the
                  development, I learned about tailwind a CSS framework, and
                  fell in love with the syntax and feel of it.

                  I created this project for Golden Shoe, a well-known British
                  shoe company that was facing a decline in revenue and needed
                  digital transformation. I used MongoDB, Express, React, Redux,
                  Nodejs and Tailwind as my tech stack to build a modern,
                  responsive and user-friendly website. I solved the challenges
                  that Golden Shoe faced such as improving the website's
                  aesthetics, creating a stock system that updates in real time,
                  implementing a search filter system that allows customers to
                  find their desired products easily, and more. This project
                  showcases my skills and creativity as a full-stack web
                  developer.

                  Quiz-Go was my university final year project. I decided on
                  creating an educational IOS mobile quiz application using the
                  language swift. The quiz-go app requires users register if
                  they haven't already and choose from a variety of topics. The
                  users information and scores is then stored using firebase as
                  the backend. The waterfall methodology was applied throughout
                  this project. Below is a link to my report and presentation
                  including diagrams of design.

                  This was my first project and an introduction to web
                  development. Here I used vanilla JavaScript HTML and CSS
                  purely as this was required for the front-end module in the
                  course. I enjoyed learning to style my elements, making them
                  come to life, and interacting with the DOM. We also learned
                  about Asynchronous code and APIs which I made use of on this
                  website.
